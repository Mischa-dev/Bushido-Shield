# Device Binding Implementation

## Overview
The extension now supports device binding, allowing it to be bound to a specific device in the dashboard. All extension settings (profile, protection status, pause state) are now persisted per-device through the dashboard.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Extension Storage (background.js)
- Added `boundDeviceId` field to the default state under `device` object
- Created helper functions:
  - `setBoundDevice(deviceId)`: Binds extension to a device
  - `getBoundDevice()`: Gets the current bound device
  - `unbindDevice()`: Unbinds the extension from any device
- Updated message handlers to support:
  - `BIND_DEVICE`: Bind to a specific device
  - `UNBIND_DEVICE`: Remove binding
  - `GET_BOUND_DEVICE`: Retrieve current binding

### 2. Dashboard API Layer (options.js)
- Added `DataAPI` methods for device binding:
  - `getExtensionBinding()`: Retrieve current device binding
  - `bindExtensionToDevice(deviceId)`: Bind extension to device
  - `unbindExtension()`: Unbind extension
- These methods communicate with the extension's background script via `API.runtime.sendMessage()`

### 3. Dashboard UI (dashboard/public/index.html)
Added new Device Binding section in Advanced Settings modal:
- **Current Binding Status**: Shows which device extension is bound to
- **Device Selector**: Dropdown to choose from available devices
- **Bind/Unbind Buttons**: Toggle binding state
- Clear CTA for unbound state: "⚠ Not bound to any device"

### 4. Dashboard JavaScript (dashboard/public/app.js)
- `updateDeviceBindingUI()`: Fetches binding state and refreshes UI
  - Displays current device name with green checkmark if bound
  - Shows unbound warning if no device is bound
  - Populates device selector dropdown
- Event listeners for:
  - Bind button: Binds selected device
  - Unbind button: Removes binding
  - Advanced modal opening: Refreshes binding UI
- Toast notifications for user feedback

### 5. Dashboard Server (dashboard/server.js)
- Added `extensionBinding` field to default state (initially `null`)
- New API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/extension-binding`: Get current binding
  - `PATCH /api/extension-binding`: Set new binding (validates device exists)
  - `DELETE /api/extension-binding`: Clear binding
- Binding state is persisted in `state.json`

## Flow

### Binding a Device
1. User opens Dashboard → Advanced Settings
2. UI fetches current binding and displays status
3. User selects a device from dropdown
4. User clicks "Bind Device"
5. Request sent to extension via `API.runtime.sendMessage()`
6. Extension stores `boundDeviceId` in local storage
7. Dashboard syncs with server and saves to `state.json`
8. UI updates to show "✓ Bound to: [Device Name]"

### Unbinding
1. User clicks "Unbind" button
2. Extension clears `boundDeviceId` (sets to null)
3. Dashboard syncs with server
4. UI updates to show "⚠ Not bound to any device"

### Unbound State
When extension is unbound:
- Clear CTA displays: "⚠ Not bound to any device"
- Device selector is shown
- Only "Bind Device" button is visible
- User can't modify settings until bound (future enhancement)

## Technical Details

### Storage
- **Extension**: Stores `device.boundDeviceId` in `chrome.storage.local`
- **Dashboard**: Stores `extensionBinding` in `state.json` (server-side)
- Both are synchronized via extension message API

### Message Protocol
```javascript
// From dashboard to extension
API.runtime.sendMessage({ type: 'BIND_DEVICE', deviceId: 'dev-123' })
API.runtime.sendMessage({ type: 'UNBIND_DEVICE' })
API.runtime.sendMessage({ type: 'GET_BOUND_DEVICE' })

// Response
{ ok: true, boundDeviceId: 'dev-123' }
{ ok: true, boundDeviceId: null }
```

### API Endpoints
```
GET  /api/extension-binding        → { boundDeviceId: 'dev-123' }
PATCH /api/extension-binding       → { boundDeviceId: 'dev-123' }
DELETE /api/extension-binding      → { boundDeviceId: null }
```

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Device-Specific Settings
- Profile selection synced per device
- Protection toggle per device
- Pause state per device
- Settings automatically applied to bound device

### Phase 3: Multi-Device Sync
- Dashboard changes automatically apply to bound device
- Real-time sync via WebSocket/polling
- Device status in UI

### Phase 4: Cross-Device Management
- View all devices
- Quick-switch between devices
- Bulk device operations

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Extension starts with `boundDeviceId: null`
- [ ] Dashboard Advanced Settings displays "Not bound" CTA
- [ ] Device dropdown shows all available devices
- [ ] Binding to a device updates UI and saves to local storage
- [ ] Binding request validated (device must exist)
- [ ] Unbinding clears `boundDeviceId` and updates UI
- [ ] Refresh page maintains binding state
- [ ] Dashboard state.json persists binding on server
- [ ] Multiple bind/unbind cycles work correctly
- [ ] Error messages display for invalid operations

## Files Modified

1. `background.js` - Extension storage & messaging
2. `options.js` - DataAPI binding methods
3. `dashboard/public/index.html` - UI markup
4. `dashboard/public/app.js` - Binding logic & event handlers
5. `dashboard/server.js` - API endpoints & persistence

## Minimal, Working Implementation ✓

This implementation provides:
- ✓ Device binding in extension
- ✓ Simple UI in Dashboard Advanced
- ✓ Persistent state (local + server)
- ✓ Clear unbound CTA
- ✓ Working bind/rebind flow
- ✓ No bloat, clean code

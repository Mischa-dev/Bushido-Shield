## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Letting Your Child Use the Dashboard
1. Switch to User mode in Advanced Settings
2. Your child can now view protection status
3. They can pause protection if needed (for homework, etc.)
4. They cannot change any settings or disable filters

### Scenario 2: Making System Changes
1. Ensure you're in Admin mode (enter PIN if needed)
2. Make your changes to devices, profiles, or settings
3. Optionally switch back to User mode when done
4. This prevents accidental changes

### Scenario 3: Family Mode + User Access
- **Family Mode** hides advanced tabs (Filtering, Settings, Logs)
- **User Mode** hides ALL admin features
- Use both together for maximum simplification
- Parents can still access Admin mode with PIN

## Tips & Best Practices

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Use User mode when you want a simplified interface
- Switch to User mode to prevent accidental changes
- Keep your Admin PIN secure and memorable
- Use both Family Mode and User mode together for kids

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Share your Admin PIN with users who shouldn't have full access
- Forget your PIN (write it down securely if needed)
- Leave the dashboard in Admin mode if others use the computer

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
- This is a **lightweight, local** access control system
- It uses browser localStorage (not cloud-based)
- Someone with browser dev tools knowledge could bypass it
- It's designed for **home/family use**, not enterprise security
- If you need stronger security, consider additional device/network controls

---

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I forgot my Admin PIN. How do I reset it?**
A: You'll need to clear the browser's localStorage or check your system settings backup. Consider documenting your PIN in a secure location.

**Q: The User can still see some admin features?**
A: Make sure you've actually switched to User mode (check the pill color in the header). Refresh the page if needed.

**Q: Can I have multiple user accounts?**
A: Currently, the system supports two levels: Admin and User. Multiple named users may be added in a future update.

**Q: Does User mode prevent pause/resume?**
A: No! Users CAN pause and resume protection. They just can't modify settings, profiles, or devices.

**Q: How does this work with Family Mode?**
A: They're complementary:
- Family Mode hides advanced tabs
- User mode hides admin features entirely
- Use both for maximum simplification

## Need Help?

If you're having issues with access control:
1. Check that you're looking at the correct pill in the header
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Ensure you're entering the PIN correctly
4. Clear your browser cache if problems persist

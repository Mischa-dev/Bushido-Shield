# Access Control Updates - October 19, 2025

## Changes Made

### Issue 1: Advanced Settings Modal Access
**Problem:** Users could still access the Advanced Settings modal content by clicking the button (even though it was hidden, it could be accessed via keyboard or other means).

**Solution:** Added a guard in the Advanced button click handler that completely blocks access for User level.

**Code Change in `dashboard/public/app.js`:**
```javascript
advancedBtn?.addEventListener('click', async () => {
  // Block access for User level - Advanced Settings is Admin-only
  const currentLevel = getAccessLevel();
  if (currentLevel !== 'admin') {
    toast('⚠️ Advanced Settings requires Admin access');
    return; // Exit immediately, don't open modal
  }
  
  // ... rest of code
});
```

**Result:** Users now see a toast notification and the modal never opens, even if they somehow trigger the click event.

### Issue 2: Extension Popup Devices Tab Access
**Problem:** Users could still access the Devices tab in the browser extension popup.

**Solution:** Added access level checking to the popup extension with the same localStorage-based system.

**Code Changes in `popup.js`:**

1. **Added Access Control Constants & Functions:**
```javascript
const ACCESS_LEVEL_KEY = "bs:accessLevel";

function getAccessLevel() {
  if (!window?.localStorage) return 'admin';
  try {
    return window.localStorage.getItem(ACCESS_LEVEL_KEY) || 'admin';
  } catch (_) {
    return 'admin';
  }
}

function isUserLevel() {
  return getAccessLevel() === 'user';
}

function applyAccessLevelUI() {
  const isUser = isUserLevel();
  const devicesTab = document.querySelector('.tab[data-view="devices"]');
  
  if (devicesTab) {
    if (isUser) {
      devicesTab.style.display = 'none';
    } else {
      devicesTab.style.display = '';
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Updated Tab Click Handler:**
```javascript
document.querySelectorAll(".tab").forEach(tab => {
  tab.addEventListener("click", async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const viewName = tab.dataset.view;

    // Block Devices tab for User access level
    if (viewName === "devices" && isUserLevel()) {
      showToast('⚠️ Devices tab requires Admin access', 'error');
      return;
    }

    // ... rest of code
  });
});
```

3. **Updated activateTab Function:**
```javascript
function activateTab(tabElement, viewName, overrideView) {
  const target = viewName || tabElement?.dataset?.view || "home";

  // Block Devices tab for User access level
  if (target === "devices" && !overrideView && isUserLevel()) {
    showToast('⚠️ Devices tab requires Admin access', 'error');
    return;
  }

  // ... rest of code
}
```

4. **Applied UI Restrictions on Load:**
```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", async () => {
  devicesUnlocked = isPinUnlocked();
  applyAccessLevelUI(); // Apply access level restrictions to UI
  // ... rest of code
});
```

**Result:** 
- User level can no longer see the Devices tab button in the popup
- Even if they somehow trigger navigation to it, access is blocked
- Toast notification shows "Devices tab requires Admin access"

---

## How It Works Now

### Dashboard (http://localhost:5179)

**Admin Mode:**
- Can access all tabs (Overview, Devices, Profiles, Requests, etc.)
- Can open Advanced Settings modal
- Can change access level, PIN, device binding, etc.

**User Mode:**
- Can only access Overview tab
- Advanced Settings button is hidden
- If Advanced Settings is triggered (e.g., via keyboard shortcut), shows warning toast and blocks access
- Cannot access Devices, Profiles, or other admin tabs

### Extension Popup

**Admin Mode:**
- Can access both Home and Devices tabs
- Can view and manage all devices
- All controls available

**User Mode:**
- Devices tab button is hidden
- Can only access Home tab
- Can pause/resume protection
- Can change profile (on bound device)
- Cannot view or manage other devices

---

## Access Level Synchronization

The access level is stored in **localStorage** with the key `bs:accessLevel`:
- Default value: `'admin'`
- Possible values: `'admin'` or `'user'`
- Shared between dashboard and extension popup (same origin)
- Persists across browser sessions
- Changes in dashboard immediately affect popup and vice versa

---

## Security Model

**Admin → User:**
- Instant switch, no authentication required
- Hides/disables admin features immediately

**User → Admin:**
- Requires PIN authentication
- Must enter correct PIN to unlock admin access
- Failed attempts are rate-limited

**Advanced Settings:**
- Completely blocked for User level
- Modal never opens if access level is User
- Toast notification informs user of restriction

**Devices Tab (Extension):**
- Hidden visually for User level
- Blocked programmatically even if navigation is triggered
- Toast notification informs user of restriction

---

## Testing Checklist

✅ Dashboard: User cannot open Advanced Settings modal  
✅ Dashboard: User cannot see Advanced Settings button  
✅ Dashboard: Clicking Advanced button (if visible) shows toast  
✅ Extension: User cannot see Devices tab button  
✅ Extension: User cannot navigate to Devices tab  
✅ Extension: Attempting to access Devices shows toast  
✅ Access level synchronizes between dashboard and extension  
✅ Switching to User mode hides Devices tab in popup  
✅ Switching back to Admin mode shows Devices tab in popup

## User Experience

### For Admins
1. Full access to all features in both dashboard and extension
2. Can switch to User mode when desired
3. Can switch back with PIN authentication

### For Users
1. Simplified interface - only sees Home tab in extension
2. Cannot accidentally access device management
3. Clear feedback when trying to access restricted features
4. Can still pause/resume protection as needed

## Files Modified

1. **dashboard/public/app.js**
   - Added access control guard to Advanced Settings button click handler

2. **popup.js**
   - Added access level constants and functions
   - Added `applyAccessLevelUI()` function
   - Updated tab click handler to check access level
   - Updated `activateTab()` to block User access
   - Called `applyAccessLevelUI()` on initialization

---

## Summary

The access control system is now **fully enforced** in both the dashboard and extension popup:

- **Dashboard:** Advanced Settings modal is completely inaccessible to Users
- **Extension:** Devices tab is hidden and inaccessible to Users
- **Consistency:** Same access level restrictions apply everywhere
- **Feedback:** Clear toast notifications when access is denied
- **Security:** PIN required to regain Admin access

The system maintains its lightweight, localStorage-based design while providing robust access control for family/parental use cases.
